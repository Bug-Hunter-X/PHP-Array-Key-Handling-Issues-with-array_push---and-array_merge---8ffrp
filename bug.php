This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to improper handling of array keys when using functions like `array_push()` or `array_merge()`.  If you attempt to push values onto an array that is not numerically indexed, the behavior might not be what you intend. The keys could become unexpectedly overwritten or result in unexpected array structures. Consider the case where keys are not sequential integers, for example strings.  If non-sequential numerical keys are used, you may find that `array_push()` adds items after the last numerical key, potentially leaving gaps in your array.
