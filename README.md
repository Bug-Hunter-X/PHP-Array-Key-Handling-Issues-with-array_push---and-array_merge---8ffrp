This repository demonstrates a common PHP bug related to unexpected behavior when using array_push() or array_merge() on arrays with non-sequential integer keys or string keys. The bug.php file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.php provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from how PHP handles key assignment in these scenarios.  Improper handling can lead to data loss or unexpected array structures.  The solution emphasizes proper key management to maintain expected array behavior and data integrity.
