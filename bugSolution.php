The solution involves using a more controlled method for adding elements to an array, such as `$array[] = $value;` which automatically appends an element, handling key assignment appropriately.  Alternatively, you can explicitly set keys when merging arrays using `array_merge()` or other array functions. This ensures that you have predictable and consistent behavior regardless of the structure of your initial array.
